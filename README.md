# bootstrapportfolio

This is a mobile responsive portolio built using basic html, boostrap css and my own personal css style sheet.  This was one of my first assignments for my coding bootcamp.  I had a lot of trouble at first figuring out how to style the page and what certain tag's were actually for. 

I am going to keep updating this page as I progress through the class. I recently removed several navigation bars, sticky footers and random other additions that were unnecessary. I have added my contact infomation and added my personal brand statement also.
